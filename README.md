## Background
Since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, the UK Government has been required to make crucial decisions with limited time and information. While these decisions were informed by medical experts, they often did not take advantage of the plethora of scholarly articles about infectious diseases.

## Objectives
Apply recent developments in natural language processing (NLP) to generate new insights in support of the Covid pandemic.

## Approach
Using the CORD-19 dataset, apply NLP techniques, such as unsupervised learning using neural networks, to understand key themes in the ~500K academic infectious disease journals. This will allow a deeper understanding about transmission, incubation, risk factors, therapeutics, and vaccines of the novel coronavirus.

## Deliverables
Dissertation detailing new or developed insights about Covid-19 and how the UK Government could take advantage of NLP.
